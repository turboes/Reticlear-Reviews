## How Reticlear Is Claimed to Work

Reticlear’s makers say the supplement supports vision health in several ways:

- **Protects retinal cells** from oxidative damage with potent antioxidants
- **Improves blood flow and nutrient delivery** to eye tissues
- **Reduces eye strain**, especially from prolonged screen use
- **Supports long-term eye wellness** by delivering vitamins and carotenoids critical for vision

The idea is not instant vision enhancement like corrective lenses, but gradual eye comfort and nutritive support over consistent use.
